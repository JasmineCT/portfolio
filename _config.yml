  discription: |
    Hey I’m Jasmine,

    I am a maritimer living a city girl life. I grew up artsy in a creative household which always helped me to work towards my artistic side. I have discovered my vibrant, quirky, and hardworking side at a young age and with graphic design I am able to harness that into my work. I love making people laugh with a great story, and helping my clients to tell their stories through design. You’ll see me around with a coca-cola in hand and dreaming about travel.

  rationales:
    colors.primary: |
      Light blue is one of the primary brand colours. It was chosen to represent my me as a person, and to add a feel of trust, calmness, and somewhat vibrant colour throughout the site.
      Purple is one of the other primary brand colours. It was chosen to accent the blue and add a feel of ambition, peace, and creativity throughout the site.
    colors.secondary: |
      This colour was chosen as a light acent to the button hovers, and links within the site to give it s softer accent.
      This colour was chosen to give more harshness to some of the linka and buttons as well.
    typefaces.primary: |
       PT Sans was chosen for its accessibility and readability for body copy.
    typefaces.cursive: |
      Adorn Smooth is a font I use as a part of my brand, so using it here makes my brand more consistent. It is a display cusrive font that will be used form headings.
    typefaces.cursive: |
      Objektiv is a font I used to mirror Avenir Next, it is a very similar font that is used as a sub heading font, and accents.
