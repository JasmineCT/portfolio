      <p>In response to the #NovaScotiaStrong movement and to show support to all those affected by the April mass shootings in Nova Scotia, Canadian Blood Services announced the launch of the #NovaScotiaStrong campaign, a two-week national blood donor recruitment event to honour the victims of the tragic shootings. The campaign consists of social media assets for all platforms, in donor center screenscapes, on site pull up banners, editable posters, and a billboard to go in the heart of Nova Scotia.</p>

    <h3 class="font-three">Background</h3>
    <p>On November 26, 1997, justice Horace Krever tabled a report to the federal government. One of Krever’s key recommendations was the creation of a new national blood authority. Canadian Blood Services assumed full responsibility for the operation of the blood supply on September 28th, 1998. Today Canadian Bool Services has imposed stem cell registry, developed the national umbilical cord blood bank, has a new role in organ and tissue donation and transplants. Since taking over operation of the blood system, their journey has gone from tragedy to trust. They now have one of the safest blood systems in the world.</p>

    <h3 class="font-three">Homework</h3>
