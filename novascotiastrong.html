    <h3 class="font-three">Background</h3>
    <p>On November 26, 1997, justice Horace Krever tabled a report to the federal government. One of Krever’s key recommendations was the creation of a new national blood authority. Canadian Blood Services assumed full responsibility for the operation of the blood supply on September 28th, 1998. Today Canadian Bool Services has imposed stem cell registry, developed the national umbilical cord blood bank, has a new role in organ and tissue donation and transplants. Since taking over operation of the blood system, their journey has gone from tragedy to trust. They now have one of the safest blood systems in the world.</p>

    <h3 class="font-three">Homework</h3>
    <p>Canadian Blood Services works under a brand guideline. Making sure everything followed the same brand and is consistent in all the designs produced.</p>
