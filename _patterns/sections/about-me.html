      <p>Growing up in New Brunswick, with open spaces ,and nature surrounding me at every turn helped me to appreciate the little things that surround you everyday. To appreciate those gorgeous sunny days, and learning to dance in the rain on those not so sunny days. Moving to Ottawa gave me that small town girl moving to the city girl vibes. Living in Ottawa has given me so many opportunities that I may not have had in New Brunswick. I really gasped onto my artistic side and expanded my skills in my new schools, and learned new things like black squirrels. When I finally had to make a decision about my next steps, art seems like an obvious route to take. I jumped around trying to expand, but finally jumped all in and I don't have a single regret. Life is about exploring, taking those big leaps and going all in.</p>

      <p>I like to look at life with humour, joy and laughter. Always cracking a joke about something to bring happiness to even the most unexpected of people. During my time at Algonquin College; expanding my skills with graphic design; has helped me to understand the patience, and creativity that goes into design. Everything comes with a purpose, and a story. From typefaces, too colours, to the small dots on the top of a logo has a meaning, has a story. Just like everyone I encounter in my life, there is a journey behind them that brought them to me. Every client that comes to me has the chance to tell that story, and gives me the chance to bring that story to life. You can get the best experience even if it’s just to chat at a cafe with some good snacks. You can always count on me to bring a smile.</p>
