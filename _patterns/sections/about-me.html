      <p>Growing up in New Brunswick, with open spaces,and nature surrounding me at every turn helped me to appreiate the little things that surround you everyday. To appreciate those gorgeous sunny days,and learning to dance inthe rain on those not so sunny days. Moving to Ottawa gave me that small town gril moving to the citry girl vibes. Living in ottawa has given me so many oportunitues that I may not have had in New Brunswick. I reaLly gasped onto my artistic side and expanded my skills in my new schools, and learned new things like black squarles. When I finally had to make a desision about my next steps, art seems like an obvious route to take. I jumped around trying to expande, but finallyjumped all in and I don't have a single regret. Life is a about exploring, taking those big leaps and going all in.  </p>

      <p>I like to looke at life with humor, joy and laughter. ALways cracking a joke about something to bring happiness to even the most unexpected of people. During my time at Algonquin College; expanding my skills with graphic design; has helped me to undertsand the patience, and creativity that goes into design. Everything comes with a purpose, and a story. From typefaces, to colours, to the small dots on the top of a logo has a meaning, has a story. Just like everyone I encounter in my life, there is a journey behind them that brought them to me. Every client that comes to me has the chance to tell that story, and gives me the chance to bring that story to life. You can get the best experience even if its just to chat at a cafe with some good snacks. You can aleays count on me to birng a smile. </p>
