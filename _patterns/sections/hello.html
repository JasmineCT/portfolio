    <p class="max-length pad-b intro">I am a maritimer living a city girl life. I grew up artsy in a creative household which always helped me to work towards my artistic side. I have discovered my vibrant, quirky, and hardworking side at a young age and with graphic design I am able to harness that into my work. I love making people laugh with a great story, and helping my clients to tell their stories through design. Youâ€™ll see me around with a coca-cola in hand and dreaming about travel.</p>
