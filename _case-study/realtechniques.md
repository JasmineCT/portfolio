intro: "Packaging design for Real Techniques Sam and Nic. A beauty company started by two sisters who wanted to create a company that values them selves on great quality brushes, and cruelty free products for women all over the world. They offer their customers tutorial on each brush, and make it easy to shop with colour cordoning brush packs. Such a great company with a large impact on the manufacturing companies should use a eco friendly packaging design with minimal plastic. With this change it can help bring the beauty industry into a more environmentally friendly space, and help reduce the plastic waste by 15%."

homework: "The main competitors of Real Techniques are Mac, Sephora, and Chanel. These companies are highly recognized in the beauty industry and sell makeup brushes world wide. While doing some homework and research on these other beauty industry packaging I found majority of makeup brushes are packaged use 60-90% of plastic. While some like Chanel and Mac use paper or metal; it is better for the environment and can be reusable. However the customers don’t get to see the brush for hygiene purposes. Real Techniques packaging offers the customer to see what the brushes they are getting. They also offer other products in their packaging, like a carriers, or bin to hold your brushes. Although some of their base brushes are not sold individually in stores. Real Techniques offers visibility on the burgess, but it uses one-use plastic that is hard on the environment. "

sketches: "During the sketching process I wanted to create a unique package design that allows to keep the brush in a hygienic state, but also give the customer a preview of the brush that they are looking for. I wanted to create a single brush packaging for real techniques base brushes because they did not sell their individual base kit brushes. "

refinements: "In this step I take the best idea, the one that jump out of the page. Being unique and speaking to the branding of the company. I take them into illustrator, and create the dyelines of the packaging to then understand how it will be built. For this step I have to make accurate measurements and continuously build them out to make sure it is understood for the manufacturing stage."
