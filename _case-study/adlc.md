intro: "Brand identity and collateral design for Animal Defence League of Canada, a non profit organization that is opposed to all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty. They value themselves on informing the public through their websites and news letters. Such a great organization deserved to have a logo that clearly represents what they stand for in a modern world."

area-sk4: "This is a close up sketch of a maple leaf with some fancy shapes creating a banner over top, with the animal defence league of Canada initials inside the banner."
sketches: "You can see my process of creating different variations of the logos. Never stopping at just idea number 1, but filling pages on pages of different ideas to get those magic ones you can't get from just going with your first idea. "
refinements: "This is the step where I take the best ideas, the ones that jump out of the page. Being unique and speaking to the values of the organization. Brining them into illustrator, and creating the cleaner versions of the sketches. Making sure they are accurate to the sketches but also making them symmetrical if needed, and making them vectorized art."

image-ref-2: "refine-2.jpg"
final: "This section is where I move forward with one of the refinements, and make all the small and important refinements. Making sure the space between the goose and the leaf are perfectly even throughout the curve, that every aspect of the logo is smooth. Finding the spacing for the words to the logo, and showcasing the vertical and horizontal versions. I also add colors to the logo."
image-meas: "measurments.jpg"
measurments: "The clear space is designed to create a clear area surrounding the logo. Ensuring that other elements do not enter this zone.
It is determined by the maple leaf element of the logo, reduced to 62% of its original size. The examples show the relevant clear space with both the word mark and solo versions of the logo."

image-type: "typefaces.jpg"
typeface: "Typography is a key feature in the A.D.L.C identity and when used correctly allows the brand to communicate in a simple yet effective way.
The typeface used for the A.D.L.C is PT Serif in regular font weight. This font is used for both the word mark in the logo and for documentation. In documentation this font will be used for both body text and for headings. "
