intro: GEM Magazine two article layouts. The non-profit organization decided to stay anonymous during the design process. The organization has a magazine that gets distributed within their community, and wanted to have a fun new layout to some of the articles going into the new issue. They tasked me with designing two of their article layouts to fit in their magazine.
brief: Create two fun magazine layouts for two different articles that are going into an existing magazine
role: "I was tasked to layout two different articles with a fun and modern look and feel to them, while still staying unified to the existing magazine."
objective: "The objective is to create fun and modern article layouts for the new issue of the magazine."
homework: "The client had some reference magazine articles that showcase the look and feel they wanted to go for in the new designs."
sketches: "I started to sketch some ideas of different magazine layouts and the different title variations that can work with the layouts. Still drawing pages on pages of layouts. Never stopping at the first few but to get those magical ideas that donâ€™t just happen on the first try."

refinements: "This is the step where I take the best ideas, the ones that jump out of the page. Keeping that fun and modern feeling going forward into the refinements. Brining elements into illustrator, creating the titles, icons, and illustrations. Once those are created and unified, then putting them into the layout with the article content and doing some shifting around to make sure everything lines up, and there are no awkward areas."

final: "After doing some trial and error with the layout to make sure everything flows and fits well on the page, I can then finalize the layouts by adding some extra elements and colours to give that extra sprinkle of fun on the page."

typeface: "The client wanted to use public typefaces to be accessible if they need to make edit or changes. I chose to go with Helvetica as the sans-serif font for the headings part of the titles, and Adobe Garamond pro for the serif font for the body and accents in the titles."
