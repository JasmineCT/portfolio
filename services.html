{% pattern sections/price-purple service="Brand Design" price="800" service-description="Before a brand can begin to form we need the basics. Your goal, your reason, I need to understand your passion and why you started your business. Just having a chat, you tell me everything I need to know about your business. This helps me to be on the same page as you and what the first step needs to be specifically for you. Once I get an idea of what your business is all about then I can start creating your brand. A mood board gives me a clear idea of the style you’re looking for and the direction you want to go in. From there the magic can start." image="brand-mocks.jpg" %}

{% pattern sections/price-blue service="Illustration" service-description="I always starting with a chat, I can get an idea of what you are looking for. Could be a fun monster illustration to talk to kids about Halloween, or you need some custom icon designs. However big or small the design, i’m up to the task." price="100" image="Illustration.jpg" %}

{% pattern sections/price-purple service="Motion Graphics" service-description="Creating a motion graphic you already know what you have in mind. It’s about piecing them together so I can bring your idea to life. I always like to start with a chat, get a vision of what you have in mind already. I can then create storyboards so you can see how it will play out, and you are involved in each step. Then the magic begins, and I can bring your character to life using motion graphics." price="800" image="cocacola.jpg" %}

{% pattern sections/price-blue service="Package Design" service-description="Having a unique package design that fits with your amazing product is a great combination to get it flying off the shelves. I like to start with a chat and get to know more about your product and the goals you have for it. A moodboard helps to give me an idea of the direction you want to go in, and what style you are looking for. Then I can start building some samples to get the best result." price="500" image="packaging.jpg" %}
